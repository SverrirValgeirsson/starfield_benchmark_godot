# starfield_benchmark_godot

I came across the YouTube videos that @amirrajan made about DragonRuby performance vs. Unity and pygame. 
So I thought it would be fun to see how it stacks up against Godot4. 

Now, I am no expert so this is a simple implementation and there may be ways of making this faster, but on my machine 
(Mac Mini 2018 3,2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7) DragonRuby and Godot seem quite similar in performance for this case.

Anyway. Hope this is of some interest to someone.

Oh, the code I based this on is here: https://gist.github.com/amirrajan/deb55a246860d4de1a0e4d7b3126994e
